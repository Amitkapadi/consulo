## Information

This is IDE based on IntelliJ Platform. The main goal of our project is creating one IDE for all programming languages.


## Building

You should use Consulo to develop Consulo. To build and run the project, 
the next plugins must be installed (with dependencies):

  * UI Designer
  * Java
  * Lombok (needed for develop)

Configure JDK as "1.6". For Windows and Linux: add `libs\tools.jar` from the JDK installation directory to the classpath of JDK.

Use 'Build | Build Artifacts... | distForRuntime' to build the project

To run the project, use the "Consulo" shared run configuration.
